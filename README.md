# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to
maximize insight into a data set;
uncover underlying structure;
extract important variables;
detect outliers and anomalies;
test underlying assumptions;
develop parsimonious models; and
determine optimal factor settings.

## Focus
- The EDA approach is precisely that--an approach--not a set of techniques, but an attitude/philosophy about how a data analysis should be carried out.

## Techniques
- Techniques	Most EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques. 
The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore, 
and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power to do so, enticing the data to reveal its structural secrets, 
and being always ready to gain some new, often unsuspected, insight into the data. 
In combination with the natural pattern-recognition capabilities that we all possess, graphics provides, of course, unparalleled power to carry this out.
